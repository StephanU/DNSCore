## Application logging

DNSCore uses log4j extensively to present the output of the application in a meaningful, consistent and easy to debug manner.

### Basic logging

Before we consider the application specific logging, let us first point out that there are two logfiles which capture the basic output of the java command. In case your ContentBroker doesn't start, have a look at the content of these files.

    ${CB_HOME}/log/stderr.log
    
The stderr output from the execution of the java command started via nohup in ContentBroker.sh. Gets created on startup. Gets overwritten completely every time the ContentBroker gets restarted. **Note** that if this file has content but it doesn't change from startup to startup, it is the stderr from the last run. After a proper run the file always should be empty.

    ${CB_HOME}/log/stdout.log
    
The stdout output from the execution of the java command started via nohup in ContentBroker.sh. Gets created on startup. Gets overwritten completely every time the ContentBroker gets restarted.

### Application specific configuration - default behaviour

The ContentBroker finds its logging configuration at

    ${CB_HOME}/conf/logback.xml
 
The file automatically gets installed by the installer. Without this file beeing present, the ContentBroker would theoretically work, but without useful logging. By the usage of this file, the ContentBroker configures itself to log into several files. These are described below

    ${CB_HOME}/log/contentbroker.log
    
This logger outputs information about the workings of the base system, which is responsible for fetching jobs from the database and making actions out of them. The business code of the actions itself gets logged by other loggers. Also setup of the ContentBroker is logged here, why it is usually a good idea to start looking here if the ContentBroker seems not to start properly.

    ${CB_HOME}/log/ingest.log
    
This logger provides information coming from the IngestScannerWorker, the component which scans the [IngestArea](processing_stages.md#ingestarea)s contractor folders for incoming SIP packages. If wonder why there are packages in the IngestArea and the ContentBroker doesn't fetch them, this file is one of the most obvious places to start debugging.

    ${CB_HOME}/log/grid.log
    
The grid log provides information about from the package grid. 
    
    ${CB_HOME}/log/object-logs

**Note** that it is also possible to override the default settings by modifying the logback.xml. This is for experimental purposes only. The logback.xml gets automatically overwritten by the installer on every update of the application so all changes will be lost after an update.
